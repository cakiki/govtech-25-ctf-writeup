> Welcome to the DeepFake Challenge! Singapore's latest AI system is on a mission: to keep our digital spaces safe from sneaky deepfakes. But before we trust it to guard the our nation from fakey, we need a true-blue human to put it to the test.

> Your task: Help the authorities separate the real from the fake in this playful online challenge. The image set is a global mixâ€”so don't expect to see your neighbour's uncle or the MRT aunty here. Instead, you'll need to rely on your sharp eyes, instincts, and maybe a bit help from the outside to spot the fakes!

> Can you really see through deepfakes and earn the flag?
