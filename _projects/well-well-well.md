> You seem to have found yourself at the bottom of an old well, with no obvious way to get out. The only thing you can find on the ground is a pile of bones next to a dusty old personal assistant device. You don't see its owner anywhere, so surely they managed to escape.
>
>You try scraping the device for clues, but almost everything is encrypted. The only usable artefact left behind came from the model's internals, a cache of some sort. You hope this is enough to get somewhere.
