> As Singapore approaches a super-aged society, healthier drink choices matter. But drinks at Singapore's coffeeshops (kopitiams) are sweetened by default.

> So forget your Starbucks lingo - this Kopitiam Auntie only understands kopitiam lingo. Plus, auntie will reward you for healthier options - less sugar, less milk, you get the gistt.

> What's more, Kopitiam Auntie recently modernized and now uses a website to receive pre-recorded voice orders. The website's voice recognition closely mimics auntie's favourite language :)
